## How It Works
* Users can add any burger of their choice, and then the user will be given options to eat the burger. Once it has been eaten, that burger will move to the other side of the screen. These burgers are stored in a database, and the burger_eaten variable is updated as the burger is eaten. 

## Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Handlebars.js
* MySQL
